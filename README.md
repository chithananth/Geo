# Geo
This project, developed during a NASA Hackathon, is a website for geologists, focusing on topics such as Remote Sensing, SAR Data, GRACE, Alaska's geological data, ARSET resources, and NASA Earth Data. The team consists of five members, with roles distributed across various domains. I was responsible for all UI/UX design and implementation, ensuring a seamless user experience. The frontend was crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while AJAX was employed for dynamic content loading and interactivity. The backend was developed using PHP, providing robust functionality and efficient data handling. This platform not only highlights essential geoscience topics but also serves as a user-friendly tool for researchers and Earth scientists.
